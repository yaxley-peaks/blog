** Editor's Introduction
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: editors-introduction
:END:
The discovery of the collection of koans known as the Rootless Root,
apparently preserved for decades in the dry upper air of the Western
Mountains, has ignited great controversy in scholarly circles. Are these
authentic documents shedding new light on the teaching of the early Unix
patriarchs? Or are they clever pastiches from a later age, commanding
the authority of semi-mythical figures such as the Patriarchs Thompson,
Ritchie and McIlroy for doctrines which evolved closer to our own era?

It is impossible to say for certain. All sides in the dispute have made
much of an alleged similarity to that venerable classic,
[[#the-tao-of-programming][The Tao of Programming]]. But Rootless Root
is quite different in tone and style from the loose, poetic anecdotes of
the James translation, focused as it is on the remarkable and enigmatic
figure of Master Foo.

It would be more apposite to seek parallels in the [[#ai-koans][AI Koans]];
indeed, there are textual clues that the author of the Rootless Root may
have redacted certain versions of the AI Koans. We are also on much
firmer ground in seeking connections with the [[#logintaka][Loginataka]]; indeed,
it is quite possible that the unknown authors of Rootless Root and of
Loginataka were one and the same person, possibly a student of Master
Foo himself.

Mention should also be made of the [[#tales-of-zen-master-greg][Tales of Zen Master Greg]], though
the Nine Inch Nails references have cast some doubt on their antiquity
and it is thus unlikely that they influenced Rootless Root.

That the title of the work was intended as a reference to the Zen
classic [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gateless_Barrier][Gateless Gate]] of Mumon, we can say with fair confidence.
There are echoes of Mumon in several of the koans.

There is considerable dispute over whether Master Foo should be assigned
to the Eastern (New Jersey) School, or the Western School that grew out
of the Patriarch Thompson's epochal early journey to Berkeley. If this
question has not been settled, it is perhaps because we cannot even
establish that Master Foo ever existed! He might merely be a composite
of a group of teachers, or of an entire dharma lineage.

Even supposing the legend of Master Foo accreted around the teaching of
some a single person, what of his favored student Nubi? Nubi has all the
earmarks of a stock figure, the perfect disciple. One is reminded of the
tales surrounding the Buddha's favorite follower Ananda. It seems likely
that there was a historical Ananda, but no trace of his actual
personality has survived the euhemerizing process by which the life of
the Buddha was polished into timeless myth.

In the end, all we can do is take these teaching stories on their own
terms, and extract what kernels of wisdom may be found there.

The redaction of the Rootless Root is a work in progress, as the source
materials present many difficulties in reconstruction and
interpretation. Future versions may include more stories as these
difficulties are overcome.

** Master Foo and the Ten Thousand Lines
Master Foo once said to a visiting programmer: “There is more Unix-nature in one
line of shell script than there is in ten thousand lines of C”.

The programmer, who was very proud of his mastery of C, said: “How can this be?
C is the language in which the very kernel of Unix is implemented!”

Master Foo replied: “That is so. Nevertheless, there is more Unix-nature in one
line of shell script than there is in ten thousand lines of C”.

The programmer grew distressed. “But through the C language we experience the
enlightenment of the Patriarch Ritchie! We become as one with the operating
system and the machine, reaping matchless performance!”

Master Foo replied: “All that you say is true. But there is still more
Unix-nature in one line of shell script than there is in ten thousand lines of
C”.

The programmer scoffed at Master Foo and rose to depart. But Master Foo nodded
to his student Nubi, who wrote a line of shell script on a nearby whiteboard,
and said: “Master programmer, consider this pipeline. Implemented in pure C,
would it not span ten thousand lines?”

The programmer muttered through his beard, contemplating what Nubi had written.
Finally he agreed that it was so.

“And how many hours would you require to implement and debug that C program?”
asked Nubi.

“Many”, admitted the visiting programmer. “But only a fool would spend the time
to do that when so many more worthy tasks await him”.

“And who better understands the Unix-nature?” Master Foo asked. “Is it he who
writes the ten thousand lines, or he who, perceiving the emptiness of the task,
gains merit by not coding?”

Upon hearing this, the programmer was enlightened.

** Master Foo and the Script Kiddie
A stranger from the land of Woot came to Master Foo as he was eating the morning
meal with his students.

“I hear y00 are very l33t”, he said. “Pl33z teach m3 all y00 know”.

Master Foo's students looked at each other, confused by the stranger's barbarous
language. Master Foo just smiled and replied: “You wish to learn the Way of
Unix?”

“I want to b3 a wizard hax0r”, the stranger replied, “and 0wn ever3one's b0xen”.

“I do not teach that Way”, replied Master Foo.

The stranger grew agitated. “D00d, y00 r nothing but a p0ser”, he said. “If y00
n00 anything, y00 wud t33ch m3”.

“There is a path”, said Master Foo, “that might bring you to wisdom”. The master
scribbled an IP address on a piece of paper. “Cracking this box should pose you
little difficulty, as its guardians are incompetent. Return and tell me what you
find”.

The stranger bowed and left. Master Foo finished his meal.

Days passed, then months. The stranger was forgotten.

Years later, the stranger from the land of Woot returned.

“Damn you!” he said, “I cracked that box, and it was easy like you said. But I
got busted by the FBI and thrown in jail”.

“Good”, said Master Foo. “You are ready for the next lesson”. He scribbled an IP
address on another piece of paper and handed it to the stranger.

“Are you crazy?” the stranger yelled. “After what I've been through, I'm never
going to break into a computer again!”

Master Foo smiled. “Here”, he said, “is the beginning of wisdom”.

On hearing this, the stranger was enlightened.
** Master Foo Discourses on the Two Paths
Master Foo instructed his students:

“There is a line of dharma teaching, exemplified by the Patriarch McIlroy's
mantra ‘Do one thing well’, which emphasizes that software partakes of the Unix
way when it has simple and consistent behavior, with properties that can be
readily modeled by the mind of the user and used by other programs”.

“But there is another line of dharma teaching, exemplified by the Patriarch
Thompson's great mantra ‘When in doubt, use brute force’, and various sutras on
the value of getting 90% of cases right now, rather than 100% later, which
emphasizes robustness and simplicity of implementation”.

“Now tell me: which programs have the Unix nature?”

After a silence, Nubi observed:

“Master, these teachings may conflict”.

“A simple implementation is likely to lack logic for edge cases, such as
resource exhaustion, or failure to close a race window, or a timeout during an
uncompleted transaction”.

“When such edge cases occur, the behavior of the software will become irregular
and difficult. Surely this is not the Way of Unix?”

Master Foo nodded in agreement.

“On the other hand, it is well known that fancy algorithms are brittle. Further,
each attempt to cover an edge case tends to interact with both the program's
central algorithms and the code covering other edge cases”.

“Thus, attempts to cover all edge cases in advance, guaranteeing ‘simplicity of
description’, may in fact produce code that is overcomplicated and brittle or
which, plagued by bugs, never ships at all. Surely this is not the Way of Unix?”

Master Foo nodded in agreement.

“What, then, is the proper dharma path?” asked Nubi.

The master spoke:

“When the eagle flies, does it forget that its feet have touched the ground?
When the tiger lands upon its prey, does it forget its moment in the air? Three
pounds of VAX!”

On hearing this, Nubi was enlightened.
